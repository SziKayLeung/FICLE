Developed for analysing short-read RNA-Seq data, existing tools for assessing alternative splicing events fail to capture the connectivity and complexity of isoforms detected from long-read sequencing, particularly those generated from targeted profiling where a deep sequencing coverage is achieved.

FICLE (**F**ull **I**soform **C**haracterisation from **L**ong-read sequencing **E**xperiments) is a tool subsequently developed to comprehensively annotate and accurately document the full reportoire of isoforms identifed from targeted full-length long-read sequencing experiment. It accurately assesses the occurrence of alternative splicing events by comparing splice sites (exon) coordinates between long-read-derived transcripts and reference transcripts, further easing visualisation of isoforms on the UCSC genome browser.
